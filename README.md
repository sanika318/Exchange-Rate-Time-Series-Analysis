# Exchange Rate Time Series Analysis
## Project Overview
This project analyzes the time series of exchange rates with a focus on Indiaâ€™s exchange rate with the U.S. dollar (USD). The data is collected monthly and provides insights into trends and patterns using different time series forecasting models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM, and Exponential Smoothing.

## Data Source
The data is sourced from the FRED API (Federal Reserve Economic Data). The dataset includes monthly average exchange rates between the Indian Rupee and the U.S. Dollar.

## Forecasting Models Used
The project employs the following forecasting models to predict future exchange rate values:

ARIMA: AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average
SARIMA: Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average
LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory neural networks
Exponential Smoothing: Smoothing technique used to make short-term predictions based on past observations.

## Project Structure
Data Collection: The data is fetched from the FRED API, which provides monthly exchange rates.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Includes visualizations and trend analysis of the exchange rate data.
Modeling and Forecasting: The project uses four different models to forecast future exchange rates.
Results and Comparison: The accuracy and performance of the models are evaluated and compared.
